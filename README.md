# Automated Patch Assessment for Program Repair at Scale
In this repository, we do automatic correctness assessment for patches generated by program repair techniques. We consider the human patch as ground truth oracle and use Random tests with Ground Truth(RGT).

#### Paper under review.

## Setup Experiment Environment

#### Add submodule defects4j and checkout the commit 486e2b4(Please note our experiment depends on several Defects4J commands)
```
git submodule add https://github.com/rjust/defects4j
git reset --hard 486e2b49d806cdd3288a64ee3c10b3a25632e991
```
#### Patches
[patches_overview.csv](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/patches_overview.csv), an overview of patches. Update it with following command:
```
./drr.py patches_overview
```
To perform sanity checks with following command:

```
./drr.py applicable_check
./drr.py plausible_check
```


#### RGT

The RGT tests generation log for [Evosuite2019](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RGT_Evosuite2019_Generation_Log.csv) and [Randoop2019](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RGT_Randoop2019_Generation_Log.csv). Individually, Evosuite2019 and Randoop2019 fail to generate cases for 31/3510  and 1080/3510 executions. There are respective 2.2% and 2.4% falky tests are found, please see the log [Flaky_Check_For_Evosuite2019](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RGT_Evosuite2019_Flaky_Check.csv) and [Flaky_Check_For_Randoop2019](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RGT_Randoop2019_Flaky_Check.csv).


### Result of RQ1/2: RGT patch assessment contradicts previously done manual analysis and false positives.
* The 10 patches from previous research classified as correct by their respective authors are actually overfitting.
* We run Evosuite2019 and Randoop2019 over 257 patches from Dcorrect. The statistics for each test execution is available at [RQ1 and 2_Result](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RG1-2_Result.csv).

### Result of RQ3: Effectiveness of RGT compared to DiffTGen.
* The detailed execution logs are available at [Evosuite2019_Execution_on_Doverfitting](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ3-Evosuite2019-Result.txt) and [Randoop2019_Execution_on_Doverfitting](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ3-Randoop2019-Result.txt)
* Overfitting patches found by Evosite2019 and Randoop2019 are individally summarized in the [statistics](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ3_Overfitting_Patches.csv).Together, they found 274 overfitting patches. 
* Overfitting patches found by DiffTGen is summarized in the [DiffTGen Result](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/DiffTGen/Result.csv).

### Result of RQ4:Time cost of RGT.
* Overfitting patches found by RGT from previous research: EvosuiteASE15, RandoopASE15, EvosuiteEMSE18 are summarized [here](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ4_Patches_Found_by_Previous_RGT.csv).
* Experiment statistics of [RQ4_RGT_From_Previous_on_Dcorrect.csv](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ4_RGT_From_Previous_on_Dcorrect.csv): 9 misclassified patches found. 
* Experiment statistics of [RQ4_RGT_From_Previous_on_Doverfitting.csv](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ4_RGT_From_Previous_on_Doverfitting.csv): 219 misclassified patches found. 

### Result of RQ5: Trade-off between test generation and effectiveness of RGT
* Individually, the ability for 30 RGT tests for identifying overfitting patches are available [Evosuite2019](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ5-Evosuite_Raw_Statistics.txt) and [Randoop2019](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ5-Randoop_Raw_Statistics.csv).
* We develop a [script](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ5-randomness-script.py) to simulate 1000 random groups that each contain 30 runs test generation. 
* Statistics that record the average test generations that achieve effectiveness of 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100%: [1000 groups of Evosuite](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ5-1000-groups-evosuite.csv) and [1000 groups of Randoop](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/RQ5-1000-groups-randoop.csv).










### Use RGT tests to access patch correctness:
Command to automatically assess the correctness of a given patch with the specific test suite.This generates a new csv file under the statistics folder in the formate of Autotest_*currentdate*.csv (e.g. Autotest_2018-11-04.csv)

```
./drr.py autotest <patch_id> <dataset:D_correct|D_incorrect|D_unassessed> <tests:ASE15_Evosuite|ASE15_Randoop|EMSE18_Evosuite>
Example:./drr.py autotest patch1-Chart-1-CapGen.patch D_correct ASE15_Evosuite

```
To reproduce our experiment results, please execute the command:
```
./drr.py RQ1/RQ3/RQ4
```

The statistics of overfitting patches found by Evosuite and Randoop in RQ3 is available [here](https://github.com/kth-tcs/defects4j-repair-reloaded/blob/master/statistics/Overfitting%20Patches%20Found%20in%20RQ3.csv).
### DiffTGen:
Before running the command, you may want to check [original DiffTGen repository](https://github.com/qixin5/DiffTGen)
```
cd DiffTGen
ant compile
./runDrr.py D_incorrect difftgen_path
```
If you want to run other patches on DiffTGen, you may want to use our script ```drr/configpatches.py``` to setup the DiffTGen required delta and oracle information. Take a look of the demo:
