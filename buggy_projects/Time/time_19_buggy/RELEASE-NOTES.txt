Joda-Time version 2.1
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the ninth release of Joda-Time.
This release contains enhancements, bug fixes and a time zone update.

We require JDK 1.5 or later as features such as generics are used.
It may be possible to use retroweaver to compile this under an earlier JDK but we haven't tried.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.

Bug fixes since 2.0
-------------------
- Ambiguous date-time when in zone with offset of 00:00 [3424669]
  A date-time constructor with an ambiguous time due to DST should choose summer time
  but for a zone with an offset of 00:00 it chose winter time

- Time-zone names [3412910]
  Names now returned in locales other than English
  The names may differ between JDK1.5 and 1.6 due to the underlying JDK data

- Time zone id parsing fixed for some longer time zones [3427389]
  Time zones like "America/Dawson_Creek" were not parsed as "America/Dawson" was matched first

- Interval/MutableInterval toString() now contains the time-zone offset [https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/pull/2]

- Javadoc fix to MutablePeriod [3413869]
