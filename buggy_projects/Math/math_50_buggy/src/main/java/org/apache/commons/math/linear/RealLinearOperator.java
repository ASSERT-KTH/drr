/**
 * This class defines a linear operator operating on real ({@code double})
 * vector spaces.
 * No direct access to the coefficients of the underlying matrix is provided.
 *
 * The motivation for such an interface is well stated by
 * <a href="#BARR1994">Barrett et al. (1994)</a>:
 * <blockquote>
 *  We restrict ourselves to iterative methods, which work by repeatedly
 *  improving an approximate solution until it is accurate enough. These
 *  methods access the coefficient matrix {@code A} of the linear system
 *  only via the matrix-vector product {@code y = A x} (and perhaps
 *  {@code z} = {@code A}<sup>T</sup> {@code x}). Thus the user need only
 *  supply a subroutine for computing {@code y} (and perhaps {@code z})
 *  given {@code x}, which permits full exploitation of the sparsity or
 *  other special structure of A.
