This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a bugzilla search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
CVS commits.  Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range 
property to the number of days since the last release.

    <release version="2.0" date="TBD" description="TBD">
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Clarified the ODE package by breaking in into several sub-packages and renaming
        classes (SwitchingFunctions/EventHandler, SwitchingFunctionsHandler/CombinedEventsManager)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-210" >
        Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.getSwitchingFunctions()
        to a collection of SwitchingFunction instances. This better suits the
        intended use of the method and fixes a visibility error since the
        previous return type referenced the package private SwitchState class.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-209" due-to="Thomas Chust">
        Fixed dimension error on output vector for the operate method
        in RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The FirstOrderDifferentialEquations and FirstOrderIntegrator
        interfaces now extends Serializable, allowing integrators and
        problems to be embedded into users Serializable classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added several convenience methods for Vector3D and Rotation.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Replaced public no argument constructors with IDENTITY or ZERO
        static instances for immutable classes Vector3D and Rotation.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Fixed inconsistencies in the naming scheme for static fields in
        Vector3D and Rotation with respect to the overall library.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Greatly improved RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl performances,
        both in terms of speed and in terms of temporary memory footprint.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-203" due-to="Mauro Talevi">
        Added Mauro's patch to support multiple regression.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal version of the Java
        platform required to compile and use commons-math is Java 5. This version
        is widely deployed now on many systems. It brings new important features
        for specific mathematical developments, for example new functions (log10,
        cbrt, ulp, signum, cosh, sinh, tanh, hypot, expm1, log1p), autoboxing,
        MathContext or RoundingMode. It also brings important features for general
        development, for example enums, generics or annotations.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Switching functions can now throw dedicated SwitchException from all their
        method. At upper call level, the various ODE integrators handle these new
        exceptions and wrap them into IntegratorException instances, hence the
        integrators methods signature did not change.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-202">
        Added the getSwitchingFunctions and clearSwitchingFunctions to the
        FirstOrderIntegrator interface and all its implementations
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Removed deprecated features. This includes the following changes. Factory-based
        instantiation replaced by setter injection in 1.2 in several classes have been
        removed. Protected fields in matrices implementations have been declared final
        and private. Identity factory methods moved to MatrixUtils class have been
        removed. Complex utilities methods that have been superseded by Complex instance
        methods have been removed.
