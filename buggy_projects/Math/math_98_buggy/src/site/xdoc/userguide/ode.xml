      <subsection name="14.1 Overview" href="overview">
        <p>
          The ode package provides classes to solve Ordinary Differential Equations problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This package solves Initial Value Problems of the form y'=f(t,y) with t<sub>0</sub>
          and y(t<sub>0</sub>)=y<sub>0</sub> known. The provided integrators compute an estimate
          of y(t) from t=t<sub>0</sub> to t=t<sub>1</sub>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All integrators provide dense output. This means that besides computing the state vector
          at discrete times, they also provide a cheap mean to get the state between the time steps.
          They do so through classes extending the
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/StepInterpolator.html">StepInterpolator</a>
          abstract class, which are made available to the user at the end of each step.
        </p>
        <p>
          All integrators handle multiple switching functions. This means that the integrator can be
          driven by discrete events (occurring when the signs of user-supplied
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/SwitchingFunction.html">switching functions</a>
          change). The steps are shortened as needed to ensure the events occur at step boundaries (even
          if the integrator is a fixed-step integrator). When the events are triggered, integration can
          be stopped (this is called a G-stop facility), the state vector can be changed, or integration
          can simply go on. The latter case is useful to handle discontinuities in the differential
          equations gracefully and get accurate dense output even close to the discontinuity. The events
          are detected when the functions signs are different at the beginning and end of the current step,
          or at several equidistant points inside the step if its length becomes larger than the maximal
          checking interval specified for the given switching function. This time interval should be set
          appropriately to avoid missing some switching function sign changes (it is possible to set it
          to <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code> if the sign changes cannot be missed).
        </p>
        <p>
          The user should describe his problem in his own classes which should implement the
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/FirstOrderDifferentialEquations.html">FirstOrderDifferentialEquations</a>
          interface. Then he should pass it to the integrator he prefers among all the classes that implement
          the <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/FirstOrderIntegrator.html">FirstOrderIntegrator</a>
          interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution of the integration problem is provided by two means. The first one is aimed towards
          simple use: the state vector at the end of the integration process is copied in the y array of the
          <code>FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate</code> method. The second one should be used when more in-depth
          information is needed throughout the integration process. The user can register an object implementing
          the <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/StepHandler.html">StepHandler</a> interface or a
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/StepNormalizer.html">StepNormalizer</a> object wrapping
          a user-specified object implementing the
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/FixedStepHandler.html">FixedStepHandler</a> interface
          into the integrator before calling the <code>FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate</code> method. The user object
          will be called appropriately during the integration process, allowing the user to process intermediate
          results. The default step handler does nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/ContinuousOutputModel.html">ContinuousOutputModel</a>
          is a special-purpose step handler that is able to store all steps and to provide transparent access to
          any intermediate result once the integration is over. An important feature of this class is that it
          implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface. This means that a complete continuous model of the
          integrated function throughout the integration range can be serialized and reused later (if stored into
          a persistent medium like a file system or a database) or elsewhere (if sent to another application).
          Only the result of the integration is stored, there is no reference to the integrated problem by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other default implementations of the <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/StepHandler.html">StepHandler</a>
          interface are available for general needs
          (<a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/DummyStepHandler.html">DummyStepHandler</a>,
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/StepNormalizer.html">StepNormalizer</a>) and custom
          implementations can be developped for specific needs. As an example, if an application is to be
          completely driven by the integration process, then most of the application code will be run inside a
          step handler specific to this application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some integrators (the simple ones) use fixed steps that are set at creation time. The more efficient
          integrators use variable steps that are handled internally in order to control the integration error
          with respect to a specified accuracy (these integrators extend the
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.html">AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator</a>
          abstract class). In this case, the step handler which is called after each successful step shows up
          the variable stepsize. The <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/StepNormalizer.html">StepNormalizer</a>
          class can be used to convert the variable stepsize into a fixed stepsize that can be handled by classes
          implementing the <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/FixedStepHandler.html">FixedStepHandler</a>
          interface. Adaptive stepsize integrators can automatically compute the initial stepsize by themselves,
          however the user can specify it if he prefers to retain full control over the integration or if the
          automatic guess is wrong.

      <subsection name="14.2 ODE Problems" href="problems">
        <p>
          First order ODE problems are defined by implementing the
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/ode/FirstOrderDifferentialEquations.html">FirstOrderDifferentialEquations</a>
          interface before they can be handled by the integrators <code>FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate</code>
          method.
        </p>
        <p>
          A first order differential equations problem, as seen by an integrator is the time
          derivative <code>dY/dt</code> of a state vector <code>Y</code>, both being one
          dimensional arrays. From the integrator point of view, this derivative depends
          only on the current time <code>t</code> and on the state vector <code>Y</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For real world problems, the derivative depends also on parameters that do not
          belong to the state vector (dynamical model constants for example). These
          constants are completely outside of the scope of this interface, the classes
          that implement it are allowed to handle them as they want.
