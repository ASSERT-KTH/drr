=head1 NAME

create_mml.pl -- create a Major-compatible MML file, which defines program mutations.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  create_mml.pl -p project_id -c classes_list -o out_dir -b bug_id

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates an MML file for the given C<bug_id>. The file F<classes_list> has to proivde the
list of classes that should be mutated.
The generated MML file is named F<C<bug_id>.mml> and written to F<out_dir>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -p C<project_id>

The id of the project for which the MML file is generated.
See L<Project|Project/"Available Project IDs"> module for available project IDs.

=item -b C<bug_id>

The bug id for which the MML file is generated. Format: C<\d+>.

=item -c F<classes_list>

The file contains all classes that should be mutated -- one class per line.

=item -o F<out_dir>
