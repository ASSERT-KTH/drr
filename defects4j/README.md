Defects4J -- version 1.2.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rjust/defects4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rjust/defects4j)
================
Defects4J is a collection of reproducible bugs and a supporting infrastructure
with the goal of advancing software engineering research.

Contents of Defects4J
================

The projects
---------------
Defects4J contains 395 bugs from the following open-source projects:

| Identifier | Project name         | Number of bugs |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Chart      | JFreeChart           |  26            |
| Closure    | Closure compiler     | 133            |
| Lang       | Apache commons-lang  |  65            |
| Math       | Apache commons-math  | 106            |
| Mockito    | Mockito              |  38            |
| Time       | Joda-Time            |  27            |

The bugs
---------------
Each bug has the following properties:

- Issue filed in the corresponding issue tracker, and issue tracker identifier
  mentioned in the fixing commit message.
- Fixed in a single commit
- Minimized: the Defects4J maintainers manually pruned out
  irrelevant changes in the commit (e.g., refactorings or feature additions).
- Fixed by modifying the source code (as opposed to configuration files,
  documentation, or test files).
- A triggering test exists that failed before the fix and passes after the fix
  -- the test failure is not random or dependent on test execution order.

The (b)uggy and (f)ixed program revisions are labelled with `<id>b` and
`<id>f`, respectively (`<id>` is an integer).

Setting up Defects4J
================

Requirements
----------------
 - Java 1.7
 - Perl >= 5.0.10
 - Perl modules: run `cpan Bundle::CSV DBD::CSV DBI` or `sudo cpan Bundle::CSV DBD::CSV DBI`
 - Git >= 1.9
 - SVN >= 1.8

All bugs have been reproduced and triggering tests verified, using the latest
version of Java 1.7.
Note that using Java 1.8+ might result in unexpected failing tests on a fixed
program version. The next major release of Defects4J will be compatible with
Java 8.

Defects4J generates and executes tests in the timezone `America/Los_Angeles`.
If you are using the bugs outside of the Defects4J framework, export the `TZ`
environment variable accordingly.

Steps to set up Defects4J
----------------

1. Clone Defects4J:
    - `git clone https://github.com/rjust/defects4j`

2. Initialize Defects4J (download the project repositories and external libraries, which are not included in the git repository for size purposes and to avoid redundancies):
    - `cd defects4j`
    - `./init.sh`

3. Add Defects4J's executables to your PATH:
    - `export PATH=$PATH:"path2defects4j"/framework/bin`

4. Check installation:
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

Using Defects4J
================

#### Example commands
1. Get information for a specific project (commons lang):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

2. Get information for a specific bug (commons lang, bug 1):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang -b 1`

3. Checkout a buggy source code version (commons lang, bug 1, buggy version):
    - `defects4j checkout -p Lang -v 1b -w /tmp/lang_1_buggy`

4. Change to the working directory, compile sources and tests, and run tests:
    - `cd /tmp/lang_1_buggy`
    - `defects4j compile`
    - `defects4j test`

5. The scripts in [`framework/test/`](tree/master/framework/test/)
are examples of how to use Defects4J, which you might find useful
as inspiration when you are writing your own scripts that use Defects4J.
